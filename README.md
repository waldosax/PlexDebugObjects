# PlexDebugObjects
Plex objects for debugging metadata agents

Reverse-engineered classes built from an archive of the documentation.
Helpful in at least knowing what to expect when bulding Plex Metadata Agents.

Can import into your Git repo as a submodule.

The internet archive of the documentation can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150212062244/http://dev.plexapp.com/docs/genindex.html).
